# Process Discipline Index (v1.0)

Purpose:
A 2am “where are the rules?” index for SquadVault process discipline.

This is an index only. Authority remains in the linked canonical documents.

## Canonical process discipline docs

- [Rules of Engagement](<../../process/rules_of_engagement.md>)
- [Canonical Patcher/Wrapper Pattern](<../../process/Canonical_Patcher_Wrapper_Pattern_v1.0.md>)
- [How to Read SquadVault](<../../canon_pointers/How_to_Read_SquadVault_v1.0.md>)
- [Canon Pointers README](<../../canon_pointers/README.md>)

## Ops reminder

- Prefer versioned patchers + wrappers over manual edits.
- Patchers must be idempotent and refuse-on-drift.
- This index is documentation-only and must not introduce new mechanics.
