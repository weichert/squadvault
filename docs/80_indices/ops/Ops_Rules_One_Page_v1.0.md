# Ops Rules — One Page (v1.0)

What this is:
A one-page operational index/excerpt of the most-used SquadVault rules for day-to-day work.

What this is not:
This document does not define new rules. Authority remains in the linked canonical sources.

## Do this always

- Use versioned patchers + wrappers (avoid manual edits): [Canonical Patcher/Wrapper Pattern](<../../process/Canonical_Patcher_Wrapper_Pattern_v1.0.md>)
- Follow the process constraints and enforcement posture: [Rules of Engagement](<../../process/rules_of_engagement.md>)
- Keep the repo clean when running proofs/CI: [CI Cleanliness Invariant](<CI_Cleanliness_Invariant_v1.0.md>)
- Maintain patcher/wrapper pairing expectations: [Patcher/Wrapper Pairing Gate](<CI_Patcher_Wrapper_Pairing_Gate_v1.0.md>)
- If stuck, use safe recovery steps: [Recovery Workflows Index](<Recovery_Workflows_Index_v1.0.md>)

## When in doubt

- Start at: [CI Guardrails Index](<CI_Guardrails_Index_v1.0.md>)
- Or use the map: [Canonical Indices Map](<Canonical_Indices_Map_v1.0.md>)
