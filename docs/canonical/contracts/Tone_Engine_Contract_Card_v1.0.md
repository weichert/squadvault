# Tone Engine — Contract Card (v1.0)

Contract Name: TONE_ENGINE  
Version: v1.0  
Status: CANONICAL  
Applies To: SquadVault Core Engine — tone governance across all narrative artifacts

Defers To:
- Canonical Operating Constitution
- Core Engine Technical Specification
- What SquadVault Is Not (Platform Guardrails)
- Data Ethics & Trust Positioning Memo
- Editorial Attunement Layer — Core Engine Addendum
- Creative Layer — Contract Card

## Purpose
The Tone Engine governs how SquadVault speaks on behalf of a group without altering facts, selection, or meaning. Tone is governed expression, not learned preference.

## In Scope
- Group-level tone configuration (explicit, versioned)
- Deterministic tone directives
- Safety and human override compatibility

## Out of Scope (Hard Stop)
- Fact modification
- Signal selection or ranking
- Intent or emotion inference
- Individual personalization
- Adaptive learning

## State
Configuration-only, group-scoped, append-only, human-controlled.

## Output
Deterministic, enumerable tone directives applied during drafting only.

## Invariants
- Identical inputs → identical outputs
- Defaults are neutral
- Tone never compensates for missing facts

## Canonical Declaration
Any behavior not explicitly permitted is forbidden.
