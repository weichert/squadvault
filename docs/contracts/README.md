# Contracts Index

Status: CANONICAL (index)

This directory contains versioned contracts that lock down **structure and interfaces**.
Contracts protect downstream creative tooling by making outputs predictable and discoverable.

## Contract Documents

- `docs/contracts/golden_path_output_contract_v1.md`
- `docs/contracts/rivalry_chronicle_contract_output_v1.md`

## Indexing Rules (enforced)

- Every file matching `docs/contracts/*_contract_v*.md` must be listed above exactly once.
- New contract versions must be added as new files (v2, v3...) — silent drift is forbidden.

## Versioned Contracts

- Contract_Markers_v1.0.md — Contract markers policy (comment-only; linkage rules) (v1.0)
