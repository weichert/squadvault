# Canon Pointers (Repo Policy)

This repository does **not** vendor canonical narrative/contract documents under a `/canon` tree.

Canonical documents live as:
- Project-file artifacts (ChatGPT project files / data-room exports)

This repo stores:
- Implementation source of truth (code + tests)
- Deterministic gates
- **Pointers** to canonical docs (this folder)

If a `/canon` folder appears in the repo, treat it as accidental and remove it unless explicitly approved.
