# Canonical Docs Pointers — Writing Room v1

These canonical documents exist as *project-file artifacts* (not currently vendored into this git repo):

- Writing Room Intake — Contract Card (v1.0)
- Writing Room Selection Set Schema (v1.0)

## Notes

- In-repo source of truth for implementation and determinism:
  - `src/squadvault/consumers/recap_writing_room_select_v1.py`
  - `src/squadvault/recaps/writing_room/selection_set_schema_v1.py`
  - Tests under `Tests/` (Writing Room v1 suite)

- When exporting canonical docs into a data room, include the above two project-file documents verbatim.
