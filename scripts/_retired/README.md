# Retired patch scripts

- Marker: `SV_PATCH_CLEANUP_EXPORT_ASSEMBLIES_HEX64_PATCH_SCRIPTS_V1`
- These patch scripts were retained for auditability but are **superseded** by the
  canonical v7 approach (define `HEX64_RE` at top of export-assemblies `main`).
- They are moved here to reduce operator confusion and avoid re-running obsolete steps.
